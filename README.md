### Hybrid_Computation_System ###
A hybrid analog-digital computation system used to compute the inverse of matrices
The project consists of two parts:
    -> MATLAB files are the experiments done using MATLAB. Iterative algorithm is used
       and different initial values are compared.
    -> Files in folder "Eigen" are C++ codes, which perform experiments using C++.
       Both direct methods and iterative mathods are implemented and compared.
